// To delegate money using Solidity, you can use a contract to manage the funds and allow users to "delegate" their funds to other users or contract addresses. Here is an example of how you might do this:

// In this example, the FundManager contract uses a mapping to store the delegations, where each key is the address of a delegator and the value is the address of their assigned delegate. The contract also has a fallback function that is triggered whenever ether is sent to the contract. This function checks if the sender has an assigned delegate, and if so, sends the ether to the delegate's address. Finally, the contract has a setDelegate function that allows users to set their delegate by calling the function and passing in the delegate's address.

// With this contract, users can send ether to the contract and it will be automatically forwarded to their assigned delegate. This allows them to delegate their funds to other users or contracts without having to manually send the ether themselves.
